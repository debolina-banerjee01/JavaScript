      A classroom consists of N students, whose friendships can be represented
      in an adjacency list. For example, the following descibes a situation
      where 0 is friends with 1 and 2, 3 is friends with 6, and so on. {0: [1,
      2], 1: [0, 5], 2: [0], 3: [6], 4: [], 5: [1], 6: [3]} Each student can be
      placed in a friend group, which can be defined as the transitive closure
      of that student's friendship relations. In other words, this is the
      smallest set such that no student in the group has any friends outside
      this group. For the example above, the friend groups would be {0, 1, 2,
      5}, {3, 6}, {4}. Given a friendship list such as the one above, determine
      the number of friend groups in the class
