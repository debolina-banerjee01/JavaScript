      On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the
      same diagonal. This includes bishops that have another bishop located
      between them, i.e. bishops can attack through pieces. You are given N
      bishops, represented as (row, column) tuples on a M by M chessboard. Write
      a function to count the number of pairs of bishops that attack each other.
      The ordering of the pair doesn't matter: (1, 2) is considered the same as
      (2, 1)
