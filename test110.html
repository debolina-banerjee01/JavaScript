    <title>Alice wants to join her school's Probability Student Club. Membership dues are computed via one of two simple 
        probabilistic games.

        The first game: roll a die repeatedly. Stop rolling once you get a five followed by a six. Your number of rolls is the 
        amount you pay, in dollars.
        
        The second game: same, except that the stopping condition is a five followed by a five.
        
        Which of the two games should Alice elect to play? Does it even matter?</title>
