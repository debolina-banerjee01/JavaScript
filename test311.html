      MegaCorp wants to give bonuses to its employees based on how many lines of
      codes they have written. They would like to give the smallest positive
      amount to each worker consistent with the constraint that if a developer
      has written more lines of code than their neighbor, they should receive
      more money. Given an array representing a line of seats of employees at
      MegaCorp, determine how much each one should get paid.
