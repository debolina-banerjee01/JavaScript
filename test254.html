      reduce (also known as fold) is a function that takes in an array, a
      combining function, and an initial value and builds up a result by calling
      the combining function on each element of the array, left to right. For
      example, we can write sum() in terms of reduce: def add(a, b): return a +
      b def sum(lst): return reduce(lst, add, 0) This should call add on the
      initial value with the first element of the array, and then the result of
      that with the second element of the array, and so on until we reach the
      end, when we return the sum of the array. Implement your own version of
      reduce.

      function reduce(array, combine, initialValue) {
        let accumulator = initialValue;

        for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
          accumulator = combine(accumulator, array[i]);
        }

        return accumulator;
      }

      // Example usage:
      function add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
      }

      function sum(lst) {
        return reduce(lst, add, 0);
      }

      console.log(sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // Output: 15
