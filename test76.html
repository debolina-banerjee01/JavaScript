    <title>In a directed graph, each node is assigned an uppercase letter. We define a path's value as the number of most 
      frequently-occurring letter along that path. For example, if a path in the graph goes through "ABACA", the value of the 
      path is 3, since there are 3 occurrences of 'A' on the path.

      Given a graph with n nodes and m directed edges, return the largest value path of the graph. If the largest value is infinite, 
      then return null.
      
      The graph is represented with a string and an edge list. The i-th character represents the uppercase letter of the i-th node. 
      Each tuple in the edge list (i, j) means there is a directed edge from the i-th node to the j-th node. Self-edges are possible, 
      as well as multi-edges</title>
