      On a mysterious island there are creatures known as Quxes which come in
      three colors: red, green, and blue. One power of the Qux is that if two of
      them are standing next to each other, they can transform into a single
      creature of the third color. Given N Quxes standing in a line, determine
      the smallest number of them remaining after any possible sequence of such
      transformations.
