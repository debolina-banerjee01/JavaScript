      Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in
      chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit
      you could have made from buying and selling that stock. You're also given
      a number fee that represents a transaction fee for each buy and sell
      transaction. You must buy before you can sell the stock, but you can make
      as many transactions as you like
