      A Collatz sequence in mathematics can be defined as follows. Starting with any positive integer: 
      if n is even, the next number in the sequence is n /2 if n is odd, the next number in the sequence is 3n + 1 It is conjectured
      that every such sequence eventually reaches the number 1. Test this conjecture.
