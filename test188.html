    <title>The sequence [0, 1, ..., N] has been jumbled, and the only clue you have for its order is an array representing whether each number is larger or 
        smaller than the last.Given this information, reconstruct an array that is consistent with it. For example, given [None, +, +, -, +], you could return 
        [1, 2, 3, 0, 4].
