      You are given a 2D matrix of 1s and 0s where 1 represents land and 0
      represents water. Grid cells are connected horizontally orvertically (not
      diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is
      exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells). An island is
      a group is cells connected horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.
      There is guaranteed to be exactly one island in this grid, and the island
      doesn't have water inside that isn't connected to the water around the
      island. Each cell has a side length of 1. Determine the perimeter of this
      island.
