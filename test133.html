      You are given a list of data entries that represent entries and exits of
      groups of people into a building. An entry looks like this: {"timestamp":
      1526579928, count: 3, "type": "enter"} 
      This means 3 people entered the
      building. An exit looks like this: {"timestamp": 1526580382, count: 2,
      "type": "exit"}. 
      Find the busiest period in the building, that is, the
      time with the most people in the building. Return it as a pair of (start,
      end) timestamps. You can assume the building always starts off and ends up
      empty, i.e. with 0 people inside.
