      Given a pivot x, and a list lst, partition the list into three parts. 
      The first part contains all elements in lst that are less than x 
      The second part contains all elements in lst that are equal to x 
      The third part contains all elements in lst that are larger than x. Ordering within a part
      can be arbitrary.
