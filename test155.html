      You are given N identical eggs and access to a building with k floors.
      Your task is to find the lowest floor that will cause an egg to break, if
      dropped from that floor. Once an egg breaks, it cannot be dropped again.
      If an egg breaks when dropped from the xth floor, you can assume it will
      also break when dropped from any floor greater than x. Write an algorithm
      that finds the minimum number of trial drops it will take, in the worst
      case, to identify this floor.
