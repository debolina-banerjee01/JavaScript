      You are given an array representing the heights of neighboring buildings
      on a city street, from east to west. The city assessor would like you to
      write an algorithm that returns how many of these buildings have a view of
      the setting sun, in order to properly value the street. Can you do this
      using just one forward pass through the array?

      function countBuildingsWithSunsetView(heights) {
        let maxSoFar = -Infinity;
        let count = 0;

        for (let i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
          if (heights[i] > maxSoFar) {
            count++;
            maxSoFar = heights[i];
          }
        }

        return count;
      }

      // Example
      const buildings = [3, 7, 8, 3, 6, 1];
      console.log(countBuildingsWithSunsetView(buildings)); // Output: 3
