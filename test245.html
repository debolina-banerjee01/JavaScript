      At a party, there is a single person who everyone knows, but who does not
      know anyone in return (the "celebrity"). To help figure out who this is,
      you have access to an O(1) method called knows(a, b), which returns True
      if person a knows person b, else False. Given a list of N people and the
      above operation, find a way to identify the celebrity in O(N) time.
