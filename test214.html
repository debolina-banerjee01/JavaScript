      There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2
      steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of
      unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.
      What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could
      climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X =
      {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.
