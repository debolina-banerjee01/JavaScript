      The "look and say" sequence is defined as follows: beginning with the term
      1, each subsequent term visually describes the digits appearing in the
      previous term. The first few terms are as follows: 1 11 21 1211 111221 As
      an example, the fourth term is 1211, since the third term consists of one
      2 and one 1. Given an integer N, print the Nth term of this sequence
